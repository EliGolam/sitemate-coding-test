# Sitemate Coding Challenge
Hi Team of Sitemate! 
Here I have created my solution for the challenge requested.

Since a single repo was requested I decided to put both the API and CLIENT together, even though I am more used to handling UI and API/backend as separate program for more modularity and scalability. 
For the API I used a simple Node.js solution and I have decided to use Vue.js for the UI. 

## How to launch the solution
### API
#### 1. Install NPM packages 
While pointing at the main solution folder, run `npm install` through the Terminal to install the necessary packages. 

#### 2. Launch the API
Launch server.js through your terminal or use the launch.js is using VS Code by simply pressing F5. 

#### 3. Test API connection
I have provided a test-client.js that can be run through the Terminal using the command: `node .\test-client.js`.
This can be easily used to test the connectivity of the API.

### UI
#### 1. Install UI Packages
Move to the UI folder: `cd .\app\client-for-issues-api` and run `npm install` through the Terminal to install the necessary packages. 

#### 2. Launch UI
Launch the Vue UI by running `npm run dev` through the Terminal. This will take you to the Front End UI.
