# Sitemate Coding Challenge
Hi Team of Sitemate! 

I am excited to present my solution for the challenge you requested. I have combined both the API and the client into a single repository as per the requirements. However, I typically prefer to manage the UI and API/backend as separate programs for better modularity and scalability. For the API, I implemented a simple Node.js solution, and for the UI, I chose to use Vue.js.

## How to launch the solution
### API
#### 1. Install NPM packages 
- Navigate to the main solution folder.
- Run `npm install` in the Terminal to install the necessary packages.

#### 2. Launch the API
- Start the API server by running `node server.js` in the Terminal.
- Alternatively, if using VS Code, you can simply press `F5` to launch server.js through the launch.json provided.

#### 3. Test API connection
I have included a test-client.js for testing purposes. Run `node test-client.js` in the Terminal to verify the connectivity of the API.

### UI
#### 1. Install UI Packages
- Navigate to the UI folder by running: `cd .\app\client-for-issues-api`
- Run `npm install` in the Terminal to install the necessary packages. 

#### 2. Launch UI
Start the Vue UI by running `npm run dev` in the Terminal. This will launch the front-end UI in your default web browser.

Thank you for considering my solution. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
